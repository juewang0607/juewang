The file “image_classification _mlp.py” trains the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model on MNIST. 
This repository is an MLP implementation of classifier on MNIST dataset with PyTorch.
The processes of my code can be broken down into following steps:
  1. Define the Network Architecture
  2. Define the training & test function for the Network
  3. Load and Visualize the data
  4. End2end training and testing pipeline
  
The file “image_classification _cnn.py” trains the Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
Similarly, this repository is an CNN implementation of classifier on MNIST dataset with PyTorch.
The processes of my code (same as previous above) can be broken down into following steps:
  1. Define the Network Architecture
  2. Define the training function and the test function
  3. Load and Visualize the data
  4. End2end training and testing pipeline
  
The attached file is the image classification summary report
